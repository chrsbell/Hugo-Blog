I feel obligated to make some sort of write up of my thoughts and what my experience has been.<!--more--></br>

# Background

I was inspired to write this after [reading this post from Nancy Hung](https://nancy-hung1068.medium.com/what-i-learned-from-my-first-software-engineering-job-pt-1-ffa05cc010ea). This is kind of a complementary post for bootcamp graduates, I recommend reading hers especially if it's more applicable.</br></br>

_Yeah so a little bit about me_...I've said that phrase so many times now as a result of the job search process. But I'll go ahead and answer again. Like many others, I'm a self-taught coder that wanted to make a career transition into tech. I was fortunate enough to be offered a position from Protenus, a healthcare compliance analytics company, as a software engineer and will begin my 3rd week on Monday. The work doesn't sound that sexy, but it's fulfilling and I'm having a great experience with my team.</br></br>

## What would I do differently?

A lot. This might be my own experience, but I placed so much pressure on myself to know everything and do things right, during the bootcamp and on the first week on the job. After all, if the companies that interview you can ask back-to-back leetcode questions and expect you to solve them coherently in 30 minutes, you need to be an algo master to get the job right?</br></br>

Well, a lot of what you'll learn is going to be on the job. I thought I needed to jump right in and start coding my first day. Instead, learning internal tools, build processes, meetings, communication, and learning from others has taken up most of time. Even though that can sound like a lot, it really isn't _at all_ compared to a bootcamp.</br></br>

If, on a 0-100 scale, Hack Reactor is 0 in terms of work/life balance my current position is 70+ and only because I still place a lot of pressure on myself. If you went to a bootcamp, you're probably familiar with working 12+ hours a day trying to learn new concepts. My experience on the job has been nothing like that, and I firmly believe now that anyone that completed a bootcamp is more than capable of succeeding as a software engineer and enjoying their job.</br></br>

### Leetcode.

I grinded about 100 questions in a month before going all out applying and tried to learn DS/Algorithms at the same time. That was stressful as hell and not worth it. Sure it depends where you want to work, if you have a FAANG interview coming up it might make sense but why put yourself through that? If you want to work at a silicon valley company you'll need to go an extra mile if it's your first SE job or don't have a CS degree also. I don't want to deter anyone from doing that, but I truly wish I did not put that amount of pressure on myself during the job search and at Hack Reactor. Especially for my first SE job.</br></br>

The kinds of companies you see advertised on LinkedIn and Glassdoor will probably have LC problems, but if I could go back I would not spend much time applying to many of those companies and _strongly_ recommend looking into companies not as heavily advertised.</br></br>

The reality is that anywhere you work you'll be working with developers more talented than you as an entry-level engineer, and they probably aren't hiring you because they expect you to be an expert at React or even JS. They want to know if you have the drive to learn and can work well in their team (that is my belief). During my first couple of weeks I've learned so much about good programming techniques and practices from my team. The best thing is that I'm actually being paid to learn and still have plenty of time to do leetcode/work on personal projects if I choose to.</br></br>

## Main Takeaway

If you're able to talk technically about some coding projects you completed, have some numbers, and most importantly are pleasant to work with you can get a job. Getting a foot in the door is the hardest part and I think it's normal that you'll need to send out a lot of applications. It depends on the job and company but I think in general the job should be nowhere near as stressful as the bootcamp. The most stressful part of the job search for me was interviewing and doing leetcode because I thought of each interview as a high-stakes scenario. So for all of the fellow perfectionists out there just take it easy sometimes, take care of your body and mind, be authentic and focus on applying to companies with some kind of a work/life balance that you won't hate yourself for working there. If you aren't a perfectionist then you're already one step ahead.</br></br>
