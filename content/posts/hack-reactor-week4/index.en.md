{{< load-photoswipe >}}

Yep, I jumped on the Bootcamp train during one of the strangest times to do so.

<!--more-->

</br></br>
During mid-June, I was browsing Reddit and came across an ad promising (not really) a six-figure salary in return for 12 weeks of coding and about 20k. </br></br>

As my site header says, I love to build and have been feeling a burning desire for a career switch for a while now. A couple of months and the cost of multiple kidneys later, I moved from coast to coast to a new city where I know no one to embark on a journey that may or may not pan out. Kinda crazy.

## Is it fun?

Uhhh sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. I can't really say that everything's been going well the whole time.</br></br>

There have been plenty of frustrating moments. It's a ton of work, studying, being forced to face _all_ of my insecurities as well as learning how to live independently and managing self-care while knowing no one in a brand new city. Yes, I have cried multiple times. It's incredibly difficult, and while I heard from multiple alumni that it was going to be extremely hard it's another thing to actually be in the situation.</br></br>

I truly wanted something difficult when I signed up for this and got way more than I bargained for.</br></br>

One prime example: almost every day there is a student presentation but if no one signs up to present, a wheel of death is brought out and a random student is chosen to do an ad hoc presentation or AMA. It landed on me for my birthday (true story) and the experience was...quite brutal for me. The times it has been enjoyable have definitely been illuminating for me, though, and I feel like I've already gained so much personal insight.

## Am I learning?

Hard to say when the floodgates to new material hell open every 2 days. But I made it this so far so I guess I am?</br></br>

My personal experience so far is that there is a bare minimum of material you need to know to do well on the self-assessments each Saturday which is already very stressful to reach, and anything beyond that is what you make of it. </br></br>

If you're like me, you may want to try and reach the advanced material or at least complete the bare minimum requirements (good luck with that) for each sprint and it sucks when you fall short of your expectations because you get burned out or for some other reason.</br></br>

No matter how smart you think you are there will be an endless amount of material and challenges for you to face, so don't worry about that part if you feel like you're already good at coding. It's definitely humbling to feel like you're decent at coding before starting and then realizing that you've been doing a ton of bad practices the whole time.

## Any tips or advice?

Some general tips that would've applied to me before starting:

- Try to know your weaknesses before starting and work on them throughout the immersive. HR will just amplify everything you're insecure about so it really is a great opportunity to better yourself.

- Study hard and efficiently, but also don't let yourself become burned out or sidetracked.

- Get to know everyone in your cohort! Join those zoom study calls and practice being vulnerable because everyone's success is your success (Big area of improvement for me).

## What's next?

The pair programming phase of HR just ended yesterday, so next week we will be building a 'mini-app' independently. Then the Monday after that is the infamous TAA, which if you pass you continue to do a Front-End capstone project and move on to the senior phase of the program. </br></br>

Every week up to the last one has progressively gotten more difficult and filled with more rabbit holes so I'm expecting more pain, but hopefully more great moments too if I can pass the TAA.
